Ancestria: Mini
===============
Ancestria: Mini is match-3 style game with a twist written in AS3 using Flixel as its backbone.

**WARNING:** it is not a finished / finalized product; please keep this in mind before you
start trolling up and down the hills of the Shire.

If you are curious and brave enough you can give it a try over [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ilpfcapnpckgnpgajapfkligeailpllh).

Where's the data?
----------------
The **data** or **resources** found in the **live build** are **properietary** which means that you
cannot get them. You could try to *extract* them from the *compiled* SWF file but that is *strongly*
discouraged for *obvious* reasons.

### What is the point then?
You are free to make a total-conversion or whatever with your own **data**, however if you do so
we would like to hear about it so don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:info@leragames.com) or 
create a ticket.

TODO
----
* upgrade Flixel (the currently bundled version is a few months old)
* a shitload of other stuff :)
